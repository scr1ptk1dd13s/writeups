# Official "Find Agent Perry" room writeup on TryHackMe

### Task 1

From the image in the task, use a reverse image search engine (Google Lens, Bing etc) and find the name of the monument.

The monument is "Arco della Pace", located in Milan.

Using Wikipedia will help you find that it was inaugurated in 1838.

### Task 2

Perry sent a new image and this time it's a stadium, the description tells us it's about 1 hour distant.

By using Google Maps we can see all Milan's stadiums, but only one matches our indications, San Siro Stadium.

Always using Wikipedia we can find out that the match played on the date was Italy - Austria, and Italy won 1 - 0.

### Task 3

Using a reverse image search engine as before, we find out that the new building this time is not in Italy but in Czech Republic, Prague.

That building is the main train station of Prague, Josef Fanta is the main architect that created it.

### Task 4

Nothing here, congratulations for completing the room.
